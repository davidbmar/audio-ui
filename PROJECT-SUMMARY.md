# Audio Recorder App - Project Summary

## 📋 Project Overview
A browser-based audio recording application with offline-first design, configurable chunking, local storage, and cloud sync capabilities. Supports both mobile and desktop web environments.

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Audio Recording**: Web Audio/MediaRecorder API with configurable chunk duration (30s-5min)  
✅ **Offline-First**: Continue recording when offline, sync when online  
✅ **Local Storage**: IndexedDB persistence with 100MB soft limit  
✅ **Cloud Sync**: Automatic S3 upload with retry logic  
✅ **File Management**: Rename, delete, tag recordings  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop optimized  
✅ **Background Operation**: Service Worker for continuous recording

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Web Audio API, MediaRecorder API, IndexedDB
- **Storage**: Local IndexedDB with cloud S3 backup
- **Background**: Service Worker for offline operation
- **Sync**: Queue-based upload with exponential backoff retry

### Key Components
1. **AudioRecorder**: Handles media capture and chunking
2. **StorageManager**: IndexedDB operations and quota management  
3. **SyncManager**: Cloud upload queue with retry logic
4. **UI Components**: Responsive React/Vue components

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Mobile Layout
- Large, touch-friendly record button
- Clear timer and chunk progress
- Swipe-friendly file list
- Prominent sync status indicators

### Desktop Layout  
- Three-column grid layout
- Hover interactions for file management
- Keyboard navigation support
- Advanced settings panel

### Key UX Patterns
- **Recording Flow**: One-touch start/stop with visual feedback
- **File Management**: Inline editing with clear sync status
- **Offline Mode**: Seamless operation without network

## 🗄️ Data Architecture

### IndexedDB Stores
- **recordings**: Audio files with metadata and sync status
- **settings**: App configuration and S3 credentials  
- **syncQueue**: Upload queue with retry management

### Sync Strategy
- Priority-based queue processing
- Exponential backoff for failed uploads
- Network-aware sync (WiFi vs mobile data)
- Background sync via Service Worker

## 🔄 Sync Logic

### Upload Flow
1. Recording created → Added to sync queue
2. Network available → Queue processing starts
3. S3 upload with progress tracking
4. Success → Remove from queue, mark as synced
5. Failure → Exponential backoff retry

### Status Indicators
- 🗂️ Local only
- 📤 Queued for sync  
- 🔄 Currently syncing
- ☁️ Synced to cloud
- ⚠️ Sync failed

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px (single column)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (two column)  
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (three column)

### Touch Optimizations
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Gesture-friendly interactions
- Battery usage optimization
- Mobile data usage controls

## 🔧 Technical Feasibility

### Browser Support
- **Modern browsers** with MediaRecorder API support
- **IndexedDB** for local storage (universal support)
- **Service Worker** for background operation
- **HTTPS required** for MediaRecorder API

### Performance Considerations
- Streaming audio chunks to avoid memory issues
- Lazy loading for large file collections
- Efficient IndexedDB queries with proper indexing
- Background sync without blocking UI

### Security
- S3 presigned URLs or IAM roles for uploads
- No sensitive data in localStorage  
- HTTPS-only operation
- Client-side data encryption (optional)
